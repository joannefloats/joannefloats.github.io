         This was my shot at making postcards based on my previous projects. <br>It was difficult to come up with an interesting design for not only for the front <br>of the post card but also the back. I also wanted them to have similar themes so that<br> they relate to one another but are also  different to show that the front has different <br>  information than the back. I went for a simplistic design with a book like layout.
